[Open Doors](https://opendoorsatl.org/) is a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://opendoorsatl.org/donate/) making connections to bring people home. Since 2013, we have helped our non-profit partners place about a thousand people per year into permanent, stable housing. The process saves time, money, and heart ache for residents â€” and just as importantly, delivers dependable, well-supported renters to property partners.

We believe technology can accelerate our mission to "ensure that homes will always be available to people exiting homelessness." To that end, we have built our Property Locator web application that matches people who desperately need affordable homes with properties that are eager for new residents. Our app serves the needs of caseworkers serving the homeless and of apartment owners and managers trying to fill vacant units.

Our technology is predominantly maintained by teams of volunteer software engineers and product experts looking to make an impact.
